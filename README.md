## gettingCleaningDataAssignment
Project work for Coursera course getting and cleaning data
The purpose of the project is to collect, work with and clean a dataset.

1. Script download_data.R downloads the required dataset to the working directory and unzips the file.
2. Script run_analysis.R reads the necessary unzipped files, merges the datasets, extracts the necessary information, labels the columns with descriptive variable names and creates a tidy dataset with variable averages. It finally writes the tidy dataset into file tidy_dataset.txt
3. File CodeBook.md is a code book describing the variables, the data and the work performed to clean up the data.
